## Print Hello

➡️ Display the word 'Hello' on the screen

In Python, `print()`{:.language-python} outputs strings (words or numbers) to the screen.

Type the code to `print()`{:.language-python} Hello to the screen:

--- code ---
---
language: python
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 10
line_highlights: 11
---

# Put code to run under here.
print(f'Hello')

--- /code ---

**Test:** Click the **Run** button. 
This is what you should see when you run your code.

<div class="c-project-output">
```
Hello
```
</div>


> ### Tip
> 
> When you type an opening bracket `(`{:.language-python} the code editor will automatically add a closing bracket `)`{:.language-python} 
This also happens when you type an opening apostrophe `'`{:.language-python}.

> ### Debugging
> 
> If you get an error then check your code really carefully. Check there are single quotes around `Hello`{:.language-python} so Python knows it is meant to be text.

> ### Tip
> 
> Coordinates start from (x=0, y=0) in the top left-hand corner. This might be different to other coordinate systems you have used.
>
>If you see an alert "Execution interrupted" when you click stop on your program, don't be concerned. This just means the normal flow of the program was stopped.
