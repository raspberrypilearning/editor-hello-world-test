<h2 class="c-project-heading--task">Print the date</h2>

--- task ---

➡️ Display the current date and time.

--- /task ---

Add another line to your code to `print` the current date and time.

Get the current date and time by using the `now()` function from the `datetime` module:

--- code ---
---
language: python
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 14
line_highlights: 16
---

print(f'{python} is good at maths!')
print(f'{111111111 * 111111111}')
print(f'The date and time is {datetime.now()}')

--- /code ---

**Test:** Click the **Run** button.
This is what you should see when you run your code, but the date and time will be different.
