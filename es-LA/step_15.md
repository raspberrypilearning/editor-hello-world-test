<h2 class="c-project-heading--task">Change the dice</h2>

--- task ---

➡️ Change the input data to an integer.
➡️ Generate a random number between 1 and the number of sides the user typed in.

--- /task ---

Inputs are always stored as text, but we need to use the input stored in `max` to specify the largest number that could be rolled. 

`max` is a string, so it needs changing to an integer `int()`.

def roll_dice():
    max = input('How many sides on your dice?:')
    print(f'That is a D {max}')
    roll = randint(1, int(max))
    print(f'You rolled a {roll} {fire * roll}')

### Tip

Changing one type of data to another type of data is called **type casting**.
